Everyone wants to lead a safe and secure life in the present society and there is a great need for modern security systems in the present society due to the increase in the thefts and bankrupts. And our lifestyle has changed a lot. Everyone is very busy and we often forget the keys of the locker, house, etc. So there is an alternative for this common problem proposed in this paper by making a digital lock that works on a 4-digit password. A simple digital door lock based on a PIC18F4520 microcontroller interacting with the user by a 16x2 LCD and 4x4 numeric keypad. The operations for the opening and closing the door are mentioned on the screen for the easy operation. The main advantage of this project is due to its low-cost and good efficiency of the PIC controller makes the project suitable for use in real life. It can also be integrated into a cloud server using Some connectivity techniques and the lock can be remotely controlled which brings the home automation into the picture.
